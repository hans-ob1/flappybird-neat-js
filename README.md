## Flappy Bird Game (with AI)
This is a clone of flappy bird game written in javascript. The AI is built using NEAT (Neuro evolution of augmented topology) algorithm. The paper associated with this implementation can be found here:
[NEAT paper](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf). To give a rough idea about the algorithm, its basically a combination of genetic algorithm with neural network. The difference between neuro-evolution of fixed topology (fixed number of hidden neurons) and NEAT is that the latter evolves not only the hidden weights but the connections and the number of neurons in a network as well.
